You have three options for running the tutorial: 

1.  Writing matlab code and running on your laptop: download or fork matlab directory (requires Matlab and some Toolboxes)

2.  Writing python code and running on your laptop: download or fork python directory. (requires Python and some data analysis packages: see crcns-student/python/getting_started.ipynb)

3.  Running python code on the cloud using Binder.  

Options 1 and 2 - require that you download the data directory as well.

To download the data you can type:

python download_data.py
